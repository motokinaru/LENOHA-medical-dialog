# LENOHA Medical Dialogue System

This repository contains the code developed for the study "**Toward Responsible AI in Healthcare: A Local, Zero-Hallucination Medical Dialogue System Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals**" submitted to *npj Digital Medicine*.

The system is designed to be fully executable on a local machine without requiring cloud services, enabling privacy-preserving and sustainable digital health interventions. It consists of:

- **FAQ-based Question Classifier**: Using Sentence Transformer models for efficient patient inquiry classification.
- **Small Talk Generator**: Powered by Swallow-8B-Instruct v0.3 for generating safe and friendly small talk responses.
- **Local Execution**: No internet connection or external API is required, ensuring data privacy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fully Local Execution**: No cloud or external API dependencies.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No patient data leaves the local environment.
- **Low Resource Requirements**: Runs on consumer-grade laptops.
- **Sustainable**: Minimal energy consumption, supporting SDG 7, 12, and 13.
- **Equity-Oriented**: Suitable for low-resource or rural healthcare settings.
